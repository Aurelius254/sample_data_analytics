# 🛒 Sample Superstore Data Analysis

This project is a data exploration and analysis of the *Sample Superstore* dataset, focusing on sales, profit, and discount patterns across categories, sub-categories, and states in the US.

## 📊 Objective

To uncover key insights that drive profitability and identify areas of high revenue but low returns, using Python for data cleaning and Tableau for interactive visualization.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python (Spyder IDE)** – for data cleaning, transformation, and initial exploration
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** – for wrangling and basic visualizations
- **Tableau Public** – for building the interactive dashboard
- **Jupyter/Spyder** – used as the code environment

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Texas was one of the highest revenue-generating states but with significant losses due to excessive discounting.
- Copiers and Phones yielded the highest profits despite moderate discount rates.
- Tables and Binders had poor profitability even with high sales, indicating potential over-discounting.
- Average discount and profit margins varied widely across states and sub-categories.
